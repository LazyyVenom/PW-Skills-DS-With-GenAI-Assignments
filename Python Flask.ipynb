    "Routing in Flask refers to the mechanism of mapping URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to specific functions, \n",
    "known as view functions, within your application. This process is handled using the `@app.route()` decorator \n",
    "provided by Flask. Each route decorator specifies a URL pattern (`'/path'`) and an HTTP method (`GET`, \n",
    "`POST`, etc.) that triggers the associated view function when a request matching that pattern is received. \n",
    "These view functions typically handle the request, process data, interact with databases, and return HTTP \n",
    "responses, which could be rendered templates, JSON data, or other forms of output. Routing allows developers \n",
    "to create dynamic web applications by defining how different URLs should be handled and what content or \n",
    "actions they should produce when accessed by clients.\n",
